# custom selection sort algorithm

->A string is taken as input in which we have to perform custom selection sort algorithm such that Capital letters appear first, then spaces and then Small letters.

-> while managing these preferences alphabetical order should be maintained.

->for eg:- input-"ArfsDE TYhv  RET"  ||   output-"ADEERTTY   fhrsv" 

->CustomSelectionSort is done using StringBuilder. 

->CustomSelectionSort2 is done using the whole string in a single line.
